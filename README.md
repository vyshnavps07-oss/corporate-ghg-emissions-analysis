# Corporate GHG Emissions Analysis Using Open Sustainability Data

## Project Overview
This project analyses real-world corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using open-source sustainability disclosure data. The analysis follows the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and aligns with IFRS S2 climate disclosure requirements.

The project demonstrates a practical ESG and climate analytics workflow using Microsoft Excel, including data cleaning, emissions calculations, and dashboard visualisation.

## Objectives
- Analyse Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 emissions
- Calculate total and scope-wise emissions in tCO₂e
- Identify emissions hotspots across scopes
- Develop an Excel-based emissions model and dashboard
- Align outputs with GHG Protocol and ISSB / IFRS S2 expectations

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from open corporate sustainability disclosures made available via the Hugging Face platform. Emissions values are extracted from publicly available sustainability and annual reports.

- Companies are anonymized and represented using unique identifiers
- Emissions are reported in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e)
- Scope 2 emissions follow the market-based approach

## Methodology
- Framework: GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard
- Scope coverage: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 3
- Units: tCO₂e
- Tool used: Microsoft Excel
- Data preparation included cleaning missing values, filtering reporting years, and aggregating emissions

## Key Outputs
- Excel-based GHG emissions calculation model
- Scope-wise emissions dashboard (pie chart and column chart)
- Summary report documenting methodology, results, and insights

## Key Insights
- Scope 3 emissions dominate total corporate emissions for most companies
- Scope 2 emissions present significant mitigation opportunities through renewable electricity sourcing
- Scope 1 emissions form a smaller but more directly controllable share
